## The screen to add Rythm to my server is gray and nothing is showing!
If you are on mobile and you find that you cannot add Rythm because the link to add Rythm produces a gray screen, please try first heading to **https://discord.com/login**, logging in and then using the invite link again.

**If that does not work**, we recommend using a desktop device to invite Rythm.

**In short:** You may want to try refreshing the website to add Rythm or use a desktop device!

## I met the error "Not supported within the Android app", what should I do?

If you encounter this error when inviting Rythm, try opening an **Incognito Tab** and copy this link into the search bar:
