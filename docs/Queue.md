## Rythm's Queue
  - If you try to play songs while another song is playing, or you try to play a playlist, Rythm will add those into a waiting queue. The order of the songs in queue is the order as you play them.

## Viewing the Queue
  - To view the queue, simply run `!queue` or `!q`

  ![ViewingQueue](/img/docs/queue/view-queue.png)

  - If there are multiple queue pages, you can either:
    + Do `!queue <Page Number>` to view that specific page. Example: `!queue 3`

    ![ViewingQueue2](/img/docs/queue/view-queue-2.png)

    + Use the reactions given to switch between pages.
