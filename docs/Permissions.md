title: Understanding Rythm's Permissions
---

## What users can use what command?

Rythm's built-in permission system can be divided into the following groups:

### Normal user without any special roles
 - Is able to add songs to the queue but can't remove other users' songs (can remove their own)
 - Is able to use commands that don't interfere with other people's music.
   - `lyrics`, `np`, `queue`, etc.
 - Can't skip a song without voting.
 - Doesn't have access to control the music in any way.

### User alone with Rythm/User with a `DJ` role or the `Manage Channels` permission
:::info note
Rythm still count you as alone with it if all other users are deafened.
:::
 - Has full access to all music commands.
 - Bypasses [`maxusersongs` setting](/settings#max-user-songs) limit.
 - Can't change Rythm's settings.

### User with `Manage Server` permission
 - Is able to change Rythm's settings.
 - Is limited to normal user's music commands, unless they have `Manage Channels` permission or `DJ` role.

### User with `Administrator` permission
 - Is able to change Rythm's settings.
 - Has full access to all music commands.

## DJ Role

### Permission/Access
DJ role grants you more permissions over Rythm. You can refer to **[here](#user-alone-with-rythmuser-with-a-dj-role-or-the-manage-channels-permission)** section to learn more about what DJ users can do.

### Setting up DJ role
:::note 
You need `Manage Roles` permission to create and assign roles in your server.
:::
1. **Create a DJ role:**
    - Go to your server settings and head to `Roles` section.
    - Create a new role without any special permission and name it `DJ`.
    - Click on `Save Changes`, and you just created a new DJ role. ðŸŽ‰<br/>

2. **Assign the DJ role to other users:**
    - Click on their name or avatar.
    - Click on `+`
    - Choose `DJ` role.<br/>
    
    ![AssignDJRole](/img/docs/perms/assign-dj.png)
    
You are all set! Rythm will automatically recognize the `DJ` role and work perfectly!

### Other DJ setttings
Use the links below to go to each setting:
1. [DJ Role](/settings#dj-role) (Set a role to be considered as DJ)
2. [DJ Only Mode](/settings#dj-only-mode)
3. [DJ Only Playlist](/settings#dj-only-playlists)

## How can I make Rythm only respond to Admins/specific roles?
In order to make Rythm commands just available to specific roles, you can do one of the following:

### DJ Only Mode
 1. Give those you want to have access a role named `DJ`
 2. Run `!settings djonly on`

### Blacklisting Channels
 1. Make a channel that can only be seen by users with the specific role.

 2. Blacklist other text channels by following [here](https://rythmbot.co/docs/permissions#how-do-i-restrict-rythm-from-being-used-in-a-specific-textvoice-channel)

## How can I give all users access to all music commands?
There is currently no setting that will apply DJ to all users. You will have to either give them the `Manage Channels` permission or the DJ role manually.

If every member in your server has a common role, you can use the following settings command to set that role to be DJ Role: `!settings djrole <Role name> / <@Role>`. To learn more, head to the [DJ role setting section](/settings/#dj-role).

## How do I restrict Rythm from being used in a specific text/voice channel?
### Block music commands from specific text channels.
You can use `!settings blacklist #channels` to blacklist specific text channels.

**Example**: `!settings blacklist #chat #gaming #international...`

![Blacklist example](/img/docs/settings/blacklist-text-channel-example.png)

If you don't want Rythm respond with the blacklist message, you can follow the guide below.

### Block Rythm completely from text/voice channels.
To disallow Rythm from being used within certain text/voice channels, you must use the Discord's permission system as described below:
1. Go to your server's settings and select `Roles`.
2. Find Rythm, revoke its `Administrator` permission and grant the `Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Manage Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Add Reactions`, `Connect` and `Speak` permissions.
   - If you have any other roles Rythm is assigned to, repeat this step for each role.
3. Save and close out of server settings.
4. Go to each text/voice channel settings you want to restrict Rythm from responding (text channel) or connecting (voice channel) to.
5. Head to the `Permissions` section âž  Click `+` âž  `Rythm`
6. On the Rythm override:
   - **For text channel:** Deny the `Read Messages` and `Send Messages` permissions.
   - **For voice channel:** Deny the `Connect` permission.
7. Save and close out of channel settings.
