![MentionAsPrefix](/img/docs/faq/mention-as-prefix.png)

### How can I change/reset Rythm's prefix in my server?
Head to the [Prefix Settings](/settings#prefix) section to learn more.

### How can I change Rythm's nickname in my server?
1. Make sure you have the `Manage Nickname` permission.
2. Then you will have to **Right Click** Rythm's name and press `Change Nickname`
3. A menu will pop up looking like this:

![NicknameMenu](/img/docs/faq/nickname-menu.png)

4. Type in your desired nickname.
5. Finally you can press `Save` and you're good to go.

### How can I change the location of Rythm Announcing Songs?
Rythm will announce songs in the channel where the first command is used.

1. Let's say you used the `!play <Song>` or the `!summon` command in the channel `#music`. Rythm will start announcing songs in that channel.
2. If you would like to change the location of the song announcements, you can do `!join` the desired channel.

### How can I view more than one page using the `queue` command?
You can view more than one queue page by doing `!queue <Page Number>`.
  - **Example:** `!queue 2`, `!queue 3`

![QueueNumber](/img/docs/faq/queue-number.png)

### How can I remove duplicate songs from the queue?
To remove duplicate songs you can use the command `!removedupes`.

Rythm will then remove all duplicates of any songs within your servers queue.

### What are the 3 emojis in `!ping` mean?
    ‚åõ - API response time   
    ‚è±Ô∏è - Message response time
    üíì - Websocket heartbeat

### Why can some normal users access moderative music commands?
1. Normal users with no special permissions are only allowed to use the `!play` command to add songs to the queue and the `!remove` command to remove their own songs in the queue.
   They can also use other commands that don't affect the playing music or the queue in any way. Example: `!queue`, `!lyrics`, `!save`.
2. However, normal users can access ALL music commands when they are alone with Rythm in the voice channel.
   This is because their commands would not affect anyone but themselves.
  - For more information about users command permissions, refer to the **[Understanding Permissions](/permissions)** section in this documentation.

### How many votes are required for a song to be vote skipped?
For a vote skip to take effect, `75%` of the people in the voice chat need to vote to skip.

**__Here's an example:__**
1. Let's assume there are `10` users in a voice chat.
2. The threshold for skipping is calculated as `75% of 10 = 7.5`, then rounded down, so `7`.
3. For the vote skip to take effect, you would then need `7 vote skips`.

:::caution note
- Vote skip will not be active until there are **3 or more people** in the voice channel.
(As with one person, insta-skip is enabled and with two the threshold for skipping is 1).
- If you have the `DJ` role or `Manage Channels` permission, you can do `!forceskip`/`!fs`, which will instantly skip the song without voting.
:::

### How can I remove my vote for song skipping?
Simply disconnect yourself from the voice channel and join again!

<!-- The start of the Limitations/Restrictions Section -->
## Limitations/Restrictions
-----
### Can I have more than one Rythm in the same server?
Yes! You can invite up to 3 releases by [clicking here](https://rythmbot.co/releases).

### Can I change Rythm's Profile Picture/Avatar in my server?
No, Discord does not allow bots to change their profile picture/avatar per server.

### Can I save or create playlists with Rythm?
No, unfortunately Rythm doesn't have a built-in feature to store playlists. But wait, there are a few solutions to this:
  - You can do `!grab` to save the current playing song into Rythm's direct messages.
  - You can save playlists from supported music sites and play them through Rythm. (See List of supported music sites below)
    
### What music sites does Rythm currently support?
These are the current sites that music can be played from.

1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
2. [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
3. [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/)
4. [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)
5. [BandCamp](https://bandcamp.com)
6. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/)

### How is it possible for Rythm to play music from Spotify?
Rythm finds the songs from Youtube and plays them.

You can play Spotify song/playlist through Rythm by just simply doing `!play <Song/Playlist url>`!

### Can I adjust the volume for everyone on my server for Rythm?
Yes, if you [donate](https://rythmbot.co/donate?do).

Rythm uses the default volume when using audio streams. In order to change the volume of these audio streams we need to enable encoding. As encoding requires a lot of computing resources, only donators can access this feature.

You may set the local volume of Rythm for yourself:
1. If you are on PC, you can right-click Rythm in the voice channel and adjust the user volume slider as shown below.

![VolumeMenu](/img/docs/faq/user-volume.png)

2. If you are on phone, click on the channel you are in then click on the user. A bar will appear at the bottom with their name and role, scroll down and you will see the option to change user volume.

![PhoneVolumeMenu](/img/docs/faq/phone-user-volume.png)

#### Donators
For donators, the volume command is `!volume <number>` (Allowed Values: `1 - 200`).

- **Example:** `!volume 80`

### Can I make custom commands for Rythm?
No, we do not allow custom commands/aliases. To check available aliases, just run the command `!aliases`.
You can suggest any aliases that you can think of in the [#rythm-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/231471142685245440/679554693403639835) channel on the [Rythm Bot Discord server](https://rythmbot.co/support).

### Can Rythm stream the video of the song that is being played?
No, Discord does not allow bots to use the `Go Live` feature.

### How is it possible for Rythm to be in so many servers all in once?
Discord allows bots in over `2,000` servers to use a feature called `Sharding`.
In Rythm's case, we are known as the largest music bot on Discord, so we require lots of shards to maintain uptime.
For more detail, please [click here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding) to view more about Discord's Sharding feature.

### Can Rythm play 24/7 Music?
No, Rythm is not a 24/7 music bot.
The reason behind this decision is because music bots require a lot of resources.
Therefore, when the bot is by itself, and not being used by anyone, these resources are still in use, leaving less availability for other people. 
If you do want a bot that plays music 24/7, you can host one with [Moosic](https://github.com/Repulser/Moosic).
Instructions on how to host this is on [Moosic's wiki](https://github.com/Repulser/Moosic/wiki).

### Can Rythm execute commands given by other bots?
No, Rythm doesn't respond to commands issued by other bots as it can be easily abused. This restriction will not be removed, nor will any exceptions be made.
