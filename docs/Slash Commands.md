Ever forget Rythm's commands? Slash commands are here!

## What are Slash Commands?
---
Slash Commands are Discord's very own version of commands, using `/` as a command prefix. You can learn more about Slash Commands [here](https://blog.discord.com/slash-commands-are-here-8db0a385d9e6).

## How to use Slash Commands?
---
Slash Commands are integrated into Rythm. All you have to do is type a slash `/` and a list of commands will pop up. Now you can look up for commands that you forget or even learn more commands that you haven't seen before.

Type the command and the required/optional arguments for it will show up. Switch between arguments by pressing `Tab`, hit `Enter` to send the command.

### How do I stop a role from using slash commands?
