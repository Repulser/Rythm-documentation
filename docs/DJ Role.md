## Permission/Access
DJ role grants you more permissions over Rythm. You can refer to **[here](/permissions#user-alone-with-rythmuser-with-a-dj-role-or-the-manage-channels-permission)** to learn more about what DJ users can do.

## Setting up DJ role
:::note
You need `Manage Roles` permission to create and assign roles in your server.
:::
1. **Create a DJ role:**
    - Go to your server settings and head to `Roles` section.
    - Create a new role without any special permission and name it `DJ`.
    - Click on `Save Changes` and ðŸŽ‰, you just created a new DJ role. <br/>

2. **Assign the DJ role to other users:**
    - Click on their name or avatar.
    - Click on `+`
    - Choose `DJ` role.<br/>

    ![AssignDJRole](/img/docs/dj-role/assign-dj.png)

You are all set! Rythm will automatically recognize the `DJ` role and work perfectly!
