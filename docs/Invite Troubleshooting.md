Rythm won't join my server!! This is an emergency what do I do?!

## When adding Rythm, I can't see my server in the list!

### Are you signed into the correct account?

If you can't find your server in the drop-down section, this can be caused by various reasons. First, you should make sure that you're signed into the correct account. If you're not, then press the blue **Not you?** button.

### Do you have permissions in the server you want to add Rythm to?

If you're **100%** sure that you're signed into the correct account, then you should make sure that you have the correct permissions. In order to add a bot, you need to have a role with the `Manage Server` or `Administrator` permission. If you're the server owner, you have those regardless, of course.

:::tip note
If you are able to change the name of the server, you have the required permissions!

### Open an incognito/private tab and invite Rythm from there.

If you're sure that **you're signed into the correct account** and **you have permissions on the server that you'd like to add Rythm to**, you should open an incognito/private tab and invite Rythm from there. Below is a table which lists the most common keyboard shortcuts for the most popular browsers on computer:

| Browser  | Windows/Linux | MacOS       |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| Chrome   | CTRL+Shift+N  | CMD+Shift+N |
| Firefox  | CTRL+Shift+P  | CMD+Shift+P |
| Opera    | CTRL+Shift+N  | CMD+Shift+N |
| MS Edge  | CTRL+Shift+N  | CMD+Shift+N |
| Explorer | CTRL+Shift+P  | N/A         |
| Safari   | N/A           | CMD+SHIFT+N |

Instructions to open an incognito/private tab for common browsers on mobile can be found in [this article](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-turn-on-private-browsing-in-android-and-ios/).

#### Why is this necessary?

Because Discord caches data into cookies, it retains old session information which Discord tries to use when inviting bots. By using an incognito/private browsing window, you force Discord to use a fresh session which should allow you to invite the bot without any issues!

## When adding Rythm, Discord asks me to verify my e-mail address.

![Unverified Discord account](/img/docs/invite-troubleshooting/unverified.png)

Discord requires you to verify your e-mail account to add bots into your servers. Head to the User Settings and verify your e-mail there.

## Anything listed above doesn't help. I am still having issues with inviting Rythm!
